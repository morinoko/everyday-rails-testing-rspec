# RSpec Practice using the *Everyday Rails Testing with RSpec* (2017 edition)

Based on the sample Rails 5.1 application for *[Everyday Rails Testing with RSpec]: A
Practical Approach to Test-driven Development* by Aaron Sumner.
This repository demonstrates incremental testing of an existing application,
starting with an untested codebase and working through model, controller,
feature, and request specs.
